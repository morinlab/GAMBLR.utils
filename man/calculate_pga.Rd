\title{Calculate proportion of genome altered by CNV.}
\usage{
calculate_pga(
  this_seg,
  seg_path,
  projection = "grch37",
  cutoff = 0.56,
  exclude_sex = TRUE,
  exclude_centromeres = TRUE,
  per_chromosome = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{this_seg}{Input data frame of seg file.}

\item{seg_path}{Optionally, specify the path to a local seg file.}

\item{projection}{Argument specifying the projection of seg file, which will
determine chr prefix, chromosome coordinates, and genome size. Default
is grch37, but hg38 is also accepted.}

\item{cutoff}{The minimum log.ratio for the segment to be considered as CNV.
Default is 0.56, which is 1 copy. This value is expected to be a
positive float of log.ratio for both deletions and amplifications.}

\item{exclude_sex}{Boolean argument specifying whether to exclude sex
chromosomes from calculation. Default is TRUE.}

\item{exclude_centromeres}{Boolean argument specifying whether to exclude
centromeres from calculation. Default is TRUE.}

\item{per_chromosome}{Boolean argument definint whether the PGA should be
calculated per total genome size (default) or per each individual
chromosome.}

\description{
\code{calculate_pga} returns a data.frame with estimated proportion
of genome altered for each sample.
}
\details{
This function calculates the percent of genome altered (PGA) by CNV.
It takes into account the total length of sample's CNV and relates it to the
total genome length to return the proportion affected by CNV. In addition,
there is an option to calculate PGA per each chromosome individually by
setting the argument "per_chromosome" to TRUE.
The input is expected to be a seg file. The path to a local SEG file can also
be provided. If The custom seg file is provided, the minimum required columns
are sample, chrom, start, end, and log.ratio.
The function can work with either individual or multi-sample seg files.
The telomeres are always excluded from calculation, and centromeres/sex
chromosomes can be optionally included or excluded.
